Solution is based on topics covered in class upto week 4

Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, then converts that distance to miles.
The conversion formula is as follows:
Miles=Kilometers√ó0.6214

	Takes number of kilmoeters from user input
	returns the number of kilometers and its conversion to miles
